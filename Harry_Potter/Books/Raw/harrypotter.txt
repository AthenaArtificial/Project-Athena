Yes, Aunt Petunia.

Yes, Uncle Vernon.

He's asleep!

Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you. Can you...hear me? It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.

Anytime.

I swear I don't know! One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!

Will I have to wear that, too?

But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.

Hey, give it back! It's mine!

Because there's no post on Sunday?

Get off! Ahh!

They're my letters! Let go of me!

Make a wish, Harry.

I-I am.

Thank you!

Excuse me, who are you?

Sorry, no.

Learned what?

I-I'm a what?

No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.

You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?

Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!

Muggle?

Okay.

First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand.

One pair of dragon-hide gloves. Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?

But you like a dragon?

All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?

Oh, nice to meet you.

Goodbye.

But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?

But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.

Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?

What's in there, Hagrid?

I still need...a wand.

Hello? Hello?

Sorry, but what's curious?

And...who owned that wand?

Wow.

He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.

Maybe if you wrote it down?

Voldemort?

Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?

What happened to...to You-Know-Who?

Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there?

Excuse me, excuse me.

Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?

Muggles?

Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-

No, not at all.

I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

The what?

We'll take the lot! 

Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?

These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?

I got Dumbledore!

Hey, he's gone!

A little.

Yeah!

I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.

Nothing... nothing, I'm fine.

Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Wow.

Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

What's he teach?

I think she fancies you.

We got lost.

I don't know, sir.

Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her.

What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

Can I borrow this? Thanks.

Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen. Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.

Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!

A century, according to McGonagall.

But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?

I-I didn't know.

Who doesn't?

What's happening?

Let's go this way.

Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?

Let's go.

Run!

Quick! Let’s hide though that door!

It's locked!

And for good reason.

Guarding something?

I think so. What are those?

What is that?

I like this ball.

What do I do with it?

I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.

I think she heard you.

Where's Hermione?

How could a troll get in?

Hermione! She doesn't know!

It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!

Hermione, move!

Do something!

Anything! Hurry up!

I don't think so. Just knocked out. 

Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.

Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.

I'm not hungry.

That explains the blood.

Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.

The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.

That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

But I-I never get mail.

It's a broomstick!

But who...?

A little.

What happened?

Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.

Exactly.

What are you wearing?

I-I've got presents?

Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.

It's some kind of cloak.

My body's gone! I'm invisible?

There was no name. It just said use it well.

Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?

Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!

There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!

Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!

Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad

How can it? Both my parents are dead.

So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?

I found him!

Go on.

I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.

We think Snape's trying to steal it.

Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.

Wait a minute. One of the teachers?

Uh, what exactly is that?

Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.

I don't understand. Is that bad?

If I didn't know better, I'd say you were scared.

But what was that thing you saved me from?

But who would choose such a life?

Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?

The Philosopher's Stone.

But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.

I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.

No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-

But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.

Snape was trying to save me?

Then-then you let the troll in.

I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.

Never!

You liar!

Admirers?

Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?

But, what happened to the Stone?

But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...

Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?

What is it?

I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon--

Now you've done it.

But she's bored. If I could only let her out for... an hour or two.

But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one. All summer.

I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.

Who are you?

Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.

Why don't you sit down?

Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything.

You can't have met many decent wizards then.

Stop, Dobby! Dobby, shh! Dobby, please stop!

Dobby, stop! Please be quiet. Are you all right?

Your family?

What terrible things? Who's plotting them?

Okay, I understand. You can't say.

Dobby? Dobby, put the lamp down. 

Give me the lamp! Dobby, stop! Get in there and keep quiet!

I was just... 

Sorry. 

Yes, sir. See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here; I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends. 

Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?

Let's go.

Sorry. Lo-lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?

The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it!

Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.

See you, Hedwig! So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform 9 3/4, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. 

Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall.

Eh, Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

No, Colin! Get out of the way. Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll know what to do.

Did you hear it?

That voice.

I heard it first in Lockhart's office, and then, again, just-- 

It's moving. I think it's going to kill.

Strange... I've never seen spiders act like that.

Oh, no. It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. 

No. No.

It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.

When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. 

"Strange"?

You think I should've told them, Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it really has been opened, then that means...

Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family, the whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.       

Well, how long will it take to make?

A month?! But, Hermione... if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!      

Thank you.

No. I think my... I think my arm's broken.

No. Not you.

Professor. I swear, I didn't.

It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.

What's that for?

Hagrid, are you okay?

Di-did you hear about Hermione?

Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?

Come on.

You heard what Hagrid said: "Follow the spiders."

Well... thank you. We'll just... go.

One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.

Let's go! Arania Exumai! Go!

Arania Exumai!

Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on, move faster! Come on, go! Get us in the air.

Come on. Pull!

We know one thing: Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets; he was innocent.

Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever.

Ron, this is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. Come on! "Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it..." Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.

Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost. He couldn't die again. And Hermione... had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.

The water... There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection. "Spiders flee before it." It all fits.

Hermione's answered that, too.

Remember what Aragog said about that girl fifty years ago, she died in a bathroom? What if she never left?

Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try to get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know! Professor, we have some information for you. Are you going somewhere?

You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?!

You wrote them!

You're a fraud. You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!

Don't even think about it. 

To ask you how you died.

Who was it, Myrtle?

Just like that? How?

This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. 

Hesha- Hassah. 

Oh, yes there is! You first.  

All right. Let's go. 

Uh... thanks, Myrtle. 

Now, remember: any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. 

This way. 

It's a snakeskin.

Ron! Ron, are you okay?

You wait here, and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.

Hesha- Hassah. 

Ginny. Ginny. No, Ginny. Please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please wake up.

Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won't wake? She's not...?

Are you a ghost?

She's as cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a Basilisk.

Give me my wand, Tom.

Listen, we've got to go. We've got to save her!

No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

But why?

And why did you want to meet me?

Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?

I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.

Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.

Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.

Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!

He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes? 

Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks. It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.

You see, sir. I couldn't help but notice certain things... certain... certain similarities between... Tom Riddle and me.

Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?

So, the Sorting Hat was right; I should be in Slytherin.

Because I asked it to.

Godric Gryffindor.

Dobby! So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys.

Now you've done it.

Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.

Nothing. School stuff.

I will if she does.   

Yes.

Okay.

Oh, yeah.

That's a lie!

My dad wasn't a drunk!

Shut up! Shut up!

No! She deserved what she got!

Yeah? Try me.

I don't care.

I fell over.

I didn't do it on purpose.

Nothing.

I didn't.

The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

But the Muggles. Can't they see us?

Who is that?

How did he escape?

Yeah.

Hedwig.

No, thank you.

I don't understand.

I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.

"The state of things," sir?

Sirius Black, you mean?

Hedwig.

Egypt. What's it like?

Mrs. Weasley.

Good to see you.

Yeah, sure.

Yeah. It should be great.

Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?

Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.

Voldemort.

Sorry.

And kill me.

Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.

Do you think he's really asleep?

I gotta tell you something.

Yeah.

Thanks, Ron.

I don't know.

Thank you.

What was that thing that came?

What happened to me?

And did either of you two... you know... pass out?

But someone was screaming.

How did he find out?

Fortuna Major.

Thank you.

Shut up, Malfoy.

What?

Hey, hey, hey!

Brilliant, professor.

At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could...

Forget about it, guys. See you later.

Professor, can I ask you something?

I did think of Voldemort at first.

Before I fainted... I heard something.

I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.

The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know.

Excuse me, sir.

Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.

Probably a right sight better than he normally does.

Oh, brilliant.

What happened?

Really? I meant the match. Who won?

I'm scared, professor.

I need to know how to fight them.

But you made it go away.

Guys, let me go.

HARRY:I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.

Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

What are you doing?!

What's this rubbish?

"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."

Hang on. This is Hogwarts.

So you mean this map shows...

Everyone?

Brilliant! Where did you get it?

I'm sure.

Expecto Patronum.

Expecto Patronum!

That's one nasty dementor.

The first time I rode a broom.

There's another.

Just do it.

I think I've had enough for today.

I was thinking of him.

Ripped to pieces?

They're not sacking you!

You tell those spiders Ron.

Sorry.

Mischief managed. Nox.

I was sleepwalking.

My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

Spare bit of parchment.

"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."

"And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."

No.

Yes, sir.

Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.

Peter Pettigrew.

It's just what I saw.

Hang on.

Fine. See you later.

Professor Trelawney...

No.

Why don't we just set him free?

Ow!

Hagrid.

What?

Wait!

That's not good. Ron, run!

Ron!

Don't worry.

I have a hunch.

Come on.

Then it'll be you!

I know why.

Who was it, then?

Expelliarmus!

Tell me about Peter.

No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!

The map was lying, then.

All they could find of Pettigrew was his...

Show me.

No!

I know what he is.

Get off!

Okay.

No. Don't worry, okay?

You okay?

Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers.

I know.

What? Come and live with you?

Expelliarmus!

Come on.

Sirius!

Sirius!

I saw my dad.

He sent the dementors away.

You mean they're gonna kill him?

It's true. Sirius is innocent.

What just happened?

I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

Hermione!

That's us.

This is not normal.

You mean we've gone back in time?

Good punch.

Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

Here they come. I'd better hurry.

That's Pettigrew.

He betrayed my parents.

Are you mad?

Ow! That hurt!

Hermione!

Get away. Get off.

Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.

Buckbeak. Okay?

Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

This way.

Come on.

How?

And now we wait.

Yeah.

Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone.

It was my dad.

You see Sirius talking to me there?

When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.

Let's go!

Thanks.

Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.

Don't worry.

Don't worry, he will!

Expecto Patronum!

You were right, Hermione.

I want to go with you.

But you're innocent.

My mother's eyes.

He's free. We did it.

I don't know.

You've been sacked.

Resigned? Why?

But Dumbledore...

None of it made any difference.

What are you talking about?

For me?

Lumos.

Hey, Big D.

Yeah.

Shut up.

I'm not doing anything.

I don't understand. How do you know...?   

Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

What?

Sorry, Hedwig.

Professor Moody.

But where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled.

Oh, no one. Bit of a tosser, really.

Really?

Okay, I was wondering.

I like riding around the trains. It takes my mind off things.

I hardly just Apparated, didn't I?

Can't imagine why.

Actually sir, after all these years, I just, sort of, go with it.

Oh yes, introductions. Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine-- Horace Slughorn. Horace... Well you know who this is.

My mother's eyes, yeah.

Sir, exactly what was all that about?

It's alright, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.

Really.

I didn't know. Dumbledore.

So when did you get here?

Oh, come on.

But, this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

What rubbish! Well, he's only... How old is he?

Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.

I reckon he's right.

So what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? And who were all those people? Don't you see? It was a ceremony. An initiation.

Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides, Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

I need some air.

Luna. How'd you know where I was?

Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.

Well, I am your friend, Luna.

Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years.

Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

Um, okay, yeah. Give it a go.

How do I look?

Brilliant!

Later. What did I miss?

Oh, this can't be good.

I had a free period this morning, Professor.

Well, it was, but I was told to have to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.

Brilliant, um... Well, I'll head there straight away.

I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet and nor is Ron.

Liquid luck.

You crush it, don't cut it.

No, really.

I'm fine, sir.

I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

Definitely.

Sir?

Oh, no, no, I mean... She's brilliant and we're friends. But no.

Did you know, sir, then?

You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach potions, did you, sir?

You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect to me.

Do you want me to let him?

Okay, so this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all for a few drills just to assess you straight. Quiet, please!

Come on, Ron.

Have you ever heard of the spell: Sectumsempra?

No.

The binding is fragile.

Yeah.

I didn't say I wasn't curious and I don't sleep with it.

There we go. That settles it, then.

Does anyone fancy a butterbeer?

No, sit aside me.

Hello sir, so wonderful to see you.

So what brings you here?

I consider it an honour, sir.

Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.

Dunno. It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

What?

She was cursed, wasn't she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. If she was delivering that to Professor Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.

It was Malfoy.

I just know.

You called Malfoy a slick git not five hours ago.

I suppose.

I don't know. Heâ€™s smart, funny, attractiveâ€”

You know, Heâ€™s got nice skin.

For- well, I mean. I'm just--I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.

I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. I think I'll be going to sleep now.

What?

I'm sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.

I think I'll be going, then.

Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

What was he like? I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents.

Have it your way, juice?

What are we talking about?

I know. I supposed I could have just used the Confundus charm.

It feels like this.

Have you?

Well, I just thought seeing is not the risk at going with who we'd really like to, We should go together, as friends.

Who are you going with?

Really?

But I am the Chosen One. Okay, sorry, um... Kidding. I'll ask someone I like. Someone cool.

Neville.

I'm--I'm fine, mate. Thanks.

Hermione, what are you doing? What happened to you?

Cormac? That's who you invited?

I think she just went to powder her nose.

Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My dateâ€”

A message?

Travelling where?

Positive. Why?

I-I worked that much out for myself, funny enough.

Lovely.

Then I'll take your word for it. So what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

I know it sounds mad.

That's not what it sounded like.

Dumbledore can make mistakes. He said so himself.

I'm not.

It's good.

Not for me. No.

Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

Did you get my owl?

Go on.

A "Vanishing Cabinet"?

What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?

Um, not yet. No.

Merry Christmas.

Stupefy!

I know who I am, Hermione, alright. Sorry.

I don't understand. What happened?

But why would he temper with his own memory?

Why?

I don't know him that well, sir.

Oh, sir, I wondered if I wanted to ask you something.

Well, you see the other day, I was in the library in the restricted section, and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.

But it just got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

Yes, he and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is... Well, he's not like you. He might misunderstand.

Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir, when he came asking questions?

Divine. Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we?

Or twenty?

Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you.

Well, brilliant.

I very well hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.

Who are you talking about?

Okay, very funny. What was that for?

Alright, fine. You're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?

Come on, Ron. I going to introduce you to Romilda Vane. I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.

Very powerful love potion.

Well, I-I thought this called for more practised hands, sir.

I'm sorry, by the way, Professor, about earlier today. Our misunderstanding.

Well, I expect you're tired a bit, after all these years. And the questions about Voldemort.

A love potion.

Ron! Ron! Professor, do something.

Come on, Ron, breathe!

Thank you.

Katie, how are you?

I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you? Sectumsempra!

The Room of Requirement.

What?

Oh, yeah.

Luck. That's it. All I need is a bit of luck.

Excellent. Really excellent.

Right. I'm going down to Hagrid's.

I know but I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's--it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?

Well, trust me. I know what I'm doing. Or Felix does. Hi!

Sorry, sir. I shouldâ€™ve announced myself. Clear my throat. Coughed. You probably thought I was Professor Sprout?

Ah well, just your general behaviour, sir. Just sneaking around, jumping when you saw me. Are those tentacular leaves, sir?

They're very valuable, aren't they?

I mean, personally, these plants always kinda freak me out.

Through the front door, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very dear friend and I just fancy paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I will be going now.

Sir?

Well then, by all means, come along, sir.

That would be counterproductive, sir.

No idea.

A dead one, I think, sir.

Not to mention the pincers.

Oh, yeah.

Poof.

Do you know why I survived, Professor? The night I got this? Because of her, because she sacrificed herself... Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.

I'm not afraid of the name, Professor. I'm going to tell you something. Something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One. Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.

Sir.

Do you mean, sir, he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux?

What are they exactly?

Tom Riddle's diary.

And the ring?

But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcruxâ€”

How would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they?

It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? When you leave the school.

You still look the same to me, sir.

Yes, sir.

My word.

Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.

Sir.

You should have let me, sir.

Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

Why can't I drink it, sir?

Professor. Professor!

Professor. Can you hear me? Professor!

You have to keep drinking like you said, remember?

I will stop. I will stop. But only-- only if you keep drinking.

I'm sorry, sir.

Just one more, sir. One more, I promise. I promise I'll do what you say.

I promise! Please!

Water.  Look, you did it, sir. Look.

Aguamenti!

Lumos. Lumos maxima! Stupefy!

Sectumsempra! Stupefy!

Incarcerous! Stupefy!

We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir to Madam Pomfrey.

Snape, he trusted you!

Incarcerous! Fight back, you coward! Fight back!

Sectumsempra!

No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. It's fake. Open it.

Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it.

I'm not coming back, Hermione. I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll leave me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can.

I never realised how beautiful this place was.



Where are we actually going?

Pleasure to meet you too sir.

Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?

Thanks.

See ya later.

I love magic.

What is THAT?

Crime? What crime?

Those people tonight, in the masks...they're his too aren't they? they're his followers.

There was a man. Before. There.

I dunno. I didn't see his face.

It's alright I'll get it.

Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.

I'm fine.

Well there's something you don't see every day.

I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.

Yeah well rather you than me.

No sir.

Yes sir.

Let you know what?

I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.

I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.

It's a broomcupboard.

I'm 14 years old. 

I dunno I haven't really thought about it.

No I didn't enter.

Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.

No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.

He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?

What are you saying?

Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?

Someone's coming!

Who says I was talking to anyone.

Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.

Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?

Is that right? Well.... what?

Well you can tell Ronald...

Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?

What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?

Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.

Ron was here?

No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.

Excuse me..

Can I have a word?

Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.

Don't worry about it.

You're a right foul git you know that?

I know so.

Yeah. Stay away from me.

I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.

Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...

Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.

But I'm not allowed a broom.

Battle a dragon.

The horntail...

Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?

What the bloody hell was that?

Caught on have you. Took you long enough.

Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.

Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.

Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?

Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?

Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...

I think I'd take the dragon right now.

But then again he can take himself.

Um. I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?

Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.

What happened to you?

What did she say?

Don't be silly.

What did you do then?

My dress robes.

Well I expect yours are more traditional.

Leave it alone.

Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.

Ready professor?

Yeah she does.

Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.

What's that supposed to mean?

Spectacular.

Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.

I must be out of my mind.

Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?

Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?

Come seek us where our voices sound.

An hour long you'll have to look.

Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?

Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.

You sure about this Neville.

For an hour.

Most likely?

You're telling me this now? You must be joking.

Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?

Do I?

But she's my friend too!

I finished last Hermione.

I can come back later Professor.

Professor?

Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?

It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.

Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?

Bubble juice sir?

I haven't stolen anything.

Fleur? Fleur!

No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.

He's bewitched!

For a moment so did I.

Some game.

Together, on three. One, two, three!

Yeah, you?

I've been here before.

I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!

Get back to the cup!

Don't touch him.

Have it your way.

He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there.

Not so much now.

The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.

I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.

Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.

It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...

That's Moody, but then who's...?

Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.

No I don't think so.

Yeah. Every week.
