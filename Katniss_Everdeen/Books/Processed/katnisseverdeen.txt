Shh, it's okay. It's okay, you were just dreaming. You were dreaming. I know. I know. But it's not. It's your first year, Prim. You're name's only been in there once, they're not gonna pick you. Try to go to sleep. Just try. Just try. You remember that song? Okay. I gotta go. I just gotta go. But I'll be back. I love you. Damn you, Gale! It's not funny! I was gonna sell it, to Peacekeepers. Oh, like you don't sell to Peacekeepers? It was the first deer I've seen in a year. Now I have nothing. But they won't, Gale. It won't happen. Yeah. Nothing! I'm not laughing at you. They'd catch us. Cut out our tongues, or worse. We wouldn't make it five miles. I have Prim and you have your brothers. Prim in the woods? I'm never having kids. But you do live here. Oh, my God! Is this real? And may the odds be ever in your favor. How many times has your name entered it? What's this? How much? Thank you. You wanna see what I got you today? It's a mockingjay pin, to protect you. And as long as you have it, nothing bad will happen to you. Okay? I promise. Prim! Prim! No! I volunteer! I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute! You need to get out of here! You need to get out of here! Go find mom! Prim, go find mom! I'm so sorry! Go find mom! Katniss Everdeen. Yes. Prim, I don't have much time. Prim, listen. You're gonna be okay. Don't take any extra food from them, it isn't worth putting in your name more times, okay? Listen, Gale will bring you game, you can sell cheese from your goat. Of course. Any maybe I can, I am smart, you know. Exactly. Thank you. You can't tune out again. No, you can't. Not like when dad died. I won't be there anymore, you're all she has. No matter what you feel, you have to be there for her. Do you understand? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't. I'm fine. I am. I may not have a bow... Animals. There's twenty four of us, Gale, and only one comes out. Yeah, and it's gonna be you. Take care of 'em, Gale. Whatever you do, don't let them starve! So why are you here then? It's no use! What's a good way to get killed? Like what? How do you find shelter? How do you find shelter? What's that? What's that? Katniss. Most people just congratulate me. So you're here to make me look pretty? Yeah, ours was coal miners. Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends. I hope not. Are you sure you should be near an opening flame? From district 1. I'm alright. Peeta's strong. He can throw a hundred pound of sack of flour right over his head, I've seen it. No, but you might have a better chance of winning if somebody comes after you with a knife. I'm done too. Throw that metal thing over there. I don't care what Haymitch said. Those guys are looking at you like you're a meal. Throw it. I just got mad. Well they look pretty startled. Thanks for your consideration. I thought they hated me. Where's Peeta? Well what about him? What? I don't feel amazing. No! And I don't know how to make people like me. How do you make people like you? That's different, I wasn't trying. Okay. What? Well, I was just hoping that I wouldn't burn to death. So did mine. Yes. In fact I'm wearing them today. Would you like to see? Yes. Yes, she did. I told her that I would try to win. That I would try to win for her. Thank you. Not yours. What the hell was that? You don't talk to me and then you say you have a crush on me? You say you wanna train alone? Is that how you wanna play? Huh? Let's start, right now! He made me look weak! We are not star crossed lovers! Can't sleep? I'm sorry I went after you. I know. Listen to them. How would they change you? You mean you won't kill anyone? Yeah. I just can't afford to think like that. I have my sister. See you tomorrow. Why not? I won't. Thanks. How long was I asleep? Thank you. So what happened while I was out? And the uhâ€¦and the boy from my district? What? So where are Cato and the others? That sounds tempting. Now this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy, so soon as you light it, move on to the next fire. Light this one last and I'll meet you back over there. And then, I'll destroy their stuff while they're chasing you. Okay. Like what? Mockingjays. That's great. We're gonna be okay. Hey, I'll see you for supper. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Every bit of it. Okay. What was it? It's gonna be fine. No! I'm not gonna leave you. I'm not gonna do that. Nobody's gonna find you in here. We'll just get you some medicine. We'll figure something out. Something. Well, you fed me once. Peeta! Ssh. Ssh. You feel hot. Peeta, stop. I'm not good at saying something. Ssh! Your medicine. Yeah, you need it and you can't walk. You would do it for me. Wouldn't you? Peeta. Okay. I'll stay. Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine. Nothing. The girl from 2, she threw a knife, but I'm okay. You got worse. I'm okay. I'm okay. Alright. Oh, my God, Peeta! We could go home. We could. We're the only team left. We should probably hunt around here. We don't have any food left. I heard the cannon! That's nightlock, Peeta! You'd be dead in a minute! You scared me to death. Damn you! She was clever. Maybe Cato likes berries too. A little after noon. They must be in a hurry to end it. No. They don't. Why should they? Trust me. Trust me. Together. Two. Why? Because I didn't die? Well, I'msorry it didn't go the way they planned. You know, I'm not very happy with them either. I felt like the happiest person in the world. I couldn't imagine life without him. We saved each other. Thank you. Thank you. It's from my district. I don't know. I guess we try to forget. How rude of them. Couple of hours. I'm sorry. Weâ€¦we shouldâ€¦we should go. Are you coming to the train station? Only a few I actually care about. It's only a few weeks. I'll be back before the snow melts. Are we gonna do this again? Gale, it was an act. I did what I had to do to survive. If I didn't I'd be dead. Haymitch! Haymitch. Haymitch. Wake up, it's tour day. Haymitch. Cameras are gonna be here in an hour. If you wanted to be babied you should've asked Peeta. No I ate at the hall, but thank you. Which is in an hour, so. Take a bath, Haymitch. Walk? I was just outâ€¦ President Snow. What an honor. Yes, I think that would save time. Yes, I think so. It must be a fragile system if it can be brought down by just a few berries. How should I imagine? No. Peeta. I'm not indifferent. Why don't you just kill me now? What do I need to do? Yes. I'll convince them. What happened to Cinna? Cinna. Yeah. Sorry, Caesar. Thanks to the generosity of the Capitol we’ve never been closer. You too. What did you say? By killing people. I’m really not in the mood for a lecture, I’ll apologize to Effie later. I thought you were Haymitch. I’ve never been very good at friends. That about sums me up. It’s like I said, I’m… The deep stuff? Uh-oh, like what? Well, now you’ve stepped over the line. Green. What’s yours? Like Effie’s hair? Did you see that? Thank you. I just wanted to say that I didn’t know Thresh I only spoke to him once. He *could’ve killed me but instead he showed me mercy. That’s a debt I’ll never be able to repay. I did know Rue. She wasn’t just my ally, she was my friend. I see her in the flowers that grow in the meadow by my house. I hear her in mockingjay song. I see her in my sister Prim. She was too young. Too gentle. And I couldn’t save her. I’m sorry. No, no! No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! No! Please, leave him alone! No! I never meant for anyone to get killed, he has to know that! Snow, he came to see me. He’s worried about the rebellion in the districts, he thinks that they don’t believe our love story. To calm things down. I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to do. He threatened to kill my family. I was thinking about Rue. Haymitch, please, please just help me get through this trip. Please, just help us get through this. We also want to share with you the sorrow of your losses. The tributes of this… The tributes of this district will reign as noble warriors through our honor to their families and prayer to their people. We are all of us united, both victors and vanquished, and serving a common purpose. Thank you. It was just a dream, I’m sorry.catching-fire-10 Peeta, will you stay with me? We are all of us united, both victors and vanquished, in serving a common purpose. The power and glory of the Capitol. Panem today, Panem tomorrow, Panem forever. We could get married. I’m serious. If like you said we’re on this train forever it’s gonna happen eventually. Why not now? It’s a little overwhelming. So are you having fun? I thought that’s what happened to Seneca Crane, too much fun. Decided? And why are you here? Why? The games don’t mean anything, they only mean to scare us. I’m not sure what else we can do. We need to talk. Into the woods, like we always talked about. We can leave right now, we can be far away from here by tonight. It’s not just me and Peeta anymore. Snow threatened to have you killed. Unless nothing now. Gale, we can do it. You said yourself that we can do it the morning of the Reaping. What do you say now? Gale, you know how I feel about you. But I can’t think about anyone that way right now. The only thing that I can think about, everyday, every waking moment since the Reaping is how afraid I am. There’s no room for anything else. But maybe if we got away from here, if we went somewhere safe, it could be different, I could be different. He’s not bluffing. Not with what’s going on in the Districts. There were people fighting in the streets. And…fires and Peacekeepers were pinning them down, but the people were… They were fighting back. We should’ve just eaten the berries in the arena and died like I was supposed to and everything would be back to normal and everyone would be safe. We have to go, Gale, before they kill us. They will kill us. I don’t want anyone looking to me! I can’t help them! I’m gonna get you out of here. Here. Yeah, hold that up there. No! No, no! Go ahead. What is that? That’s hurting him! Hey. I’m not going anywhere. I’m gonna stay right here, cause all kinds of trouble. Okay, um…I’ll get him more snow. Hey. It’s not my eye that’s bothering me. How can we live like this? How can anybody live like this? What can you see? You understand that whatever I do comes back to you and mom. I don’t want you to get hurt. I love you. Peeta… I’m here to drink. It means we have to save him. Come on, Haymitch. Nobody decent ever wins the games. Peeta has to survive. We have to do whatever it takes to save him. Haymitch, thank you. You can help him in the arena, like you did for me. I don’t care, do whatever you can. Peeta lives, not me. Promise me. I didn’t say goodbye. No, I didn’t say goodbye! No! Goodbye! Thank you. No. That just put us higher in their kill list. How could any of us even trust each other? What’s with her teeth? Finnick Odair, right? You’re kidding? A guy like that has to know she’s not gonna make it, and when it really comes down to it he won’t protect her. How did we get here, huh? Hello, Finnick. No, thanks. But I would love to borrow that outfit someday. I outgrew them. Well, I don’t like jewels and I have more money than I need, so. What did you do with all your wealth anyway? Well then how do people pay for the pleasure of your company? I’m an open book. Everybody always seems to know my secrets before I know them myself. To know all my secrets. That should be easy. Well, we’ve learned from the best. This tributes are crazy. Thank you. I don’t think that the whole world… Okay. So far I’m not overwhelmed by our choices. You should move your hands downward. And faster too. Plutarch? How do you know? Looks like glass. Probably my fault, I shot an arrow at them last year. How can you tell? Is that…is that obvious or something? Because the force field is taking up too much energy. That’s beautiful. I saw you volunteer for that young girl. That was really brave. Prim is my sister. If you um…if you teach me how to make a fish hook like that I could teach you how to hunt. Do you want to try it with me? Okay. I’ll go first. I want Wiress and Beetee. Mags. Alright, fine, then no one. Peeta, how are we gonna kill these people? A wedding dress? God, does anybody actually believe this? Thank you. Snow made me wear it. Oh, don’t go crying on me now, Caesar. You know I wouldn’t believe you even if you did. Yes. President Snow thought everyone would want to see it. Like a Mockingjay. There’s no way they’ll cancel, they can’t. Thank you, Effie. Any last advice? Haymitch, wait. Remember our deal. Do whatever it takes to keep him alive. Promise me. I don’t want to be with anyone else in there, just you. That’s what I want. That dress was beautiful. I think it’s the best one you’ve ever made. I just wanted to tell you because I don’t know… No! Cinna! No! No! No! No! No! Cinna! No! No! No! No! Peeta! Where did you get that? You think that’s funny? Good to hear. Haymitch isn’t here. Peeta, no! Peeta? Peeta? He’s not breathing! He’s not breathing! He’s not breathing! Peeta! Peeta. Peeta. Please, wake up. Please, wake up. Please, Peeta. Peeta. Peeta! Peeta! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. You were dead. You were dead. You’re heart stopped. Do you…you wanna stand up? Hang on. The force field, it’s a dome. We’re at the edge of the arena. I couldn’t find any signs of fresh water. Not a chance. Why don’t you get some rest? I’ll take the first watch. He’s okay, I think. Just…dehydrated like the rest of us. Eight. Drink up? It’s from Haymitch. I think it’s a spile. I counted twelve. Or the number of districts. Okay. Run! Run! The fog is poisoned! Peeta! I can’t carry him. Peeta, please. Peeta, please stand up. We have to go. *Peeta, please! Finnick. Finnick! Finnick, we have to go. We have to get out of here. We have to go. The water! The water helps. We need our weapons. I’m sorry about, Mags. Peeta? Walk over here slowly. Get to the beach. Who is that? You think she sacrificed herself? That doesn’t make any sense. Thank you. Someone’s here. What’s wrong with her? We can get some. Hey! Get off of her! For me? What does that mean? Come on let’s get you cleaned up. Tick tock. Tick tock. Okay What does Beetee have there? Did he get it from the Cornucopia? Alright. It’s…it’s a clock. It’s a clock. Oh, my God. It’s a clock! Wiress, you’re a genius! You’re a genius! This entire arena seems to be laid off like a clock with a new threat every hour, but they stay only within their wedge. It all starts with the lightning, then blood rain, fog, monkeys. That’s the first four hours. At ten that big wave hits from over there. That’s where the lightning strikes at noon and midnight. That big tree. And then then ten to eleven the wave. What about everything else? Did you guys see anything? So besides Brutus and Enobaria, who’s left? Prim! Prime! Prim! Prim! Prim! Prim! Prim! Finnick! No! It’s not her. Finnick, it’s not her! It’s just a jabberjay. It’s not her. Gale. Peeta! Prim! Thank you. Who’s Annie? Is she the one that went a little…? Lightning strikes that tree. Yeah, why not? If it fails, no harm done anyway, right? I think we need to go. I think so too. And once the careers are dead we both know what happens next. I don’t want to be the one that shoots first. We might still end up dead. They’re not gonna make that same mistake again. You know and I know there’s only one person walking out of here. And it’s gonna be one of us. Peeta. What about you? I do. I need you. Yeah, why can’t Finnick and Johanna stay with you and Peeta and I take the coil? No. There’s no problem. I’ll see you at midnight. There’s something… Peeta. Peeta. Beetee. Beetee! Peeta! Peeta! What are you doing with them? What the hell are you doing in here? Where’s Peeta? Thirteen? Where’s Peeta? Where is he? You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You promised me that you would save him over me! You promised me! You’re a liar! You’re a liar! You’re…You…you… Are we home? Gale? Where’s Prim? Got them out? They’re not in twelve? Start simple. Start with what you know is the truth. My name is Katniss Everdeen. My home is District 12. I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped. Peeta…Peeta was left behind. Just five more minutes. No. No, please, don’t. It’s just five more… Don’t touch me! Don’t! No! No! Get off of me! Finnick. Is there any news? We were always told there was nothing left of 13. Katniss, President Alma Coin. What about Peeta? Is he alive? You left him there. You left Peeta in that arena to die. Peeta was the one who was supposed to live! Then you should’ve saved Peeta. I need to see it for myself. Yeah. I’m sure. Figures. Hey! Come on. Don’t you wanna see Prim? There you go. Oh, you’re breaking my heart. Shh. I smuggled him in. I got Dad. And I got some of your herbs from the kitchen. You’re alive. I’m sorry. It’s just a nightmare. Peeta. Will you stay with me? No one hates the Capitol more than me, and I want to help, but I just keep thinking, even if we win this war, what happens to Peeta? And I know he’s not safe there, but he’s definitely not safe here. I should wake you up more often, Little Duck. You, too. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I’ve decided I’ll be your Mockingjay, but I have some conditions. Peeta and the other Tributes, Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta, will be rescued at the earliest opportunity. If and when Peeta is liberated, he will receive a full and unconditional pardon. No punishment will be inflicted. And the same goes for the other Tributes. It’s not their fault you abandoned them in the arena. They’re doing and saying whatever they can to survive. The Victors will be granted immunity and you will announce that in front of the entire population of 13. You will hold yourself and your government responsible or you will find another Mockingjay. My sister gets to keep her cat. I hardly ever see children around here. Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too. Effie? What are you doing here? Plutarch rescued you? Cinna. He’s dead, isn’t he? They’re beautiful. Okay. Okay. People of Panem, we fight! We dare to end this hunger for justice! Maybe I don’t recognize you sober. People of Panem, we fight! We dare! We end this hunger for justice! You’ll never be able to guarantee my safety. I want to go. Make sure you get it on camera.
